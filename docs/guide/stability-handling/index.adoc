## Stability Level

A level of stability can be associated to features and packages.

Stability levels are ordered in the following way:

`default` (the higher level of stability) > `community` > `preview` > `experimental` (the lower stability level)

A feature-pack can contain features and packages at different level of stability, allowing to provision installations at different stability levels.

### Default stability levels

When building a feature-pack, the `<feature-pack>` XML element contained in the `feature-pack.xml` descriptor can include attributes to specify 
the default stability levels that will be enabled when using the feature-pack during provisioning. 
If no such stability levels exist, `default` level is assumed.

The stability attributes are:

* `config-stability-level="<default|community|preview|experimental>"` attribute is used to declare the default stability level of the features present in the provisioned configurations.
* `package-stability-level="<default|community|preview|experimental>"` attribute is used to declare the default stability level of the provisioned packages.

### Stability levels can be overridden at provisioning time

It is possible to control the expected level of stability at provisioning time by means of the following Galleon options:

* `config-stability-level=<default|community|preview|experimental>`: To enable a given stability level for the provisioned configurations.
* `package-stability-level=<default|community|preview|experimental>`: To enable a given stability level for the provisioned packages.
* `stability-level=<default|community|preview|experimental>`: An option to enable both configs and packages stability levels. It can't be set when `config-stability-level` or `package-stability-level` are set.
